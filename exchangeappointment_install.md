   - **.NET CLR Version**: No Managed Code
   - **Managed Pipeline Mode**: Integrated

### 3.3 Add IIS Web Application - Website Configuration

### 3.4 Configuration
Edit the `appsettings.json` file with the following parameters:
> ðŸ’¡ For reference, see the `exchangeappointment_appsettings_sample.json` file located in the GitHub repository.


#### Host Configuration
```json
"Host": {
  "WebHostUrl": "https://addonhost/workspace/exchangeappointment",
  "WSUrl": "http://workspacehost/workspace/api",
  "WsApiKey": "test", // API key generated for integration user
  "HealthCheckBaseUrl": "http://addonhost", // optional
  "CustomApiKey": "test",
  "PathBase": "/workspace/exchangeappointment",
  "DebugMode": false,
  "DisableRequestLog": false,
  "DisableMetadata": true,
  "VariablePrefix": "" // Ensures compatibility when the workflow sending events to the integration service is an embedded workflow and uses prefixed variable names.
},
"Storage": {
        "Password": "test" // This password has to match with the storage.password value in the Workspace appsettings.json
    },
```

#### Exchange Server Settings
```json
"Exchange": {
  "Host": "https://mail.domain.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx",
  "Username": "your-username",
  "Password": "your-password",
  "Domain": "your-domain"
},
```

#### HMAC Configuration
```json
"Hmac": {
  "Secret": "demo"
}
```

#### Reference Filter Configuration
- **Purpose**: Controls which events the integration service processes based on the `Reference` value in the event.
- **Behavior**:
  - If the `Filter` list is **not empty**, the integration service will **only process events** that contain a reference included in the `Filter` list.
  - If the `Filter` list is **empty**, the service will process **all events**, regardless of their `Reference` value.
- **Usage**: Populate the `Filter` list with user-defined keys to restrict the scope of processed events.

```json
"Reference": {
  "Filter": ["Email"]
},
```

#### Logging (Serilog) Configuration
```json
"Serilog": {
  "Using": ["Serilog.Sinks.Seq"],
  "LevelSwitches": {
    "$controlSwitch": "Information"
  },
  "MinimumLevel": {
    "ControlledBy": "$controlSwitch",
    "Override": {
      "System": "Warning",
      "Microsoft": "Error"
    }
  },
  "WriteTo": [{
    "Name": "Seq",
    "Args": {
      "serverUrl": "http://global_seq:5341",
      "apiKey": ""
    }
  }],
  "Enrich": ["FromLogContext", "WithMachineName", "WithThreadId"],
  "Properties": {
    "Application": "EmailWorker"
  }
}
```

## 4. Logging
By default, logs are sent to an SEQ server. Optionally, configure file or database logging as needed.

---

## 5. Restart
After completing the setup, restart the application pool in IIS Manager to apply the changes.

---

## 6. Updating the Exchange Appointment Add-on
1. **Stop** the application pool in IIS Manager.
2. Replace the existing `ExchangeAppointment` folder with the updated version.
3. If required, modify the `appsettings.json` file and add any new keys provided.
